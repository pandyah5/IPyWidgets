# IPyWidgets
This is a collection of programs that demonstrate the implementation of dynamic plots of parametric functions with real-time updation of parameters using interactive widgets.

# Disclaimer
Unfortunately, IPyWidgets is confined to Jupyter Notebooks. However, they provide great interactive interfaces and are a lot of fun to play with. For more info visit: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Widget%20Basics.html

If you need universal support on widgets 'Tkinter' is the libarary to go to. Have fun, keep coding ;)
